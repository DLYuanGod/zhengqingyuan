I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. My advisor is Prof. [Yanfang (Fanny) Ye](http://yes-lab.org/). Under Prof. Ye's supervision, I collaborate with my [lab mates](http://yes-lab.org/students.html) and Prof. [Lichao Sun](https://lichao-sun.github.io/).

I am now working on NLP, deep learning (about methods of training models), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal training research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [zyuan2@nd.edu](zyuan2@nd.edu).

My research interest includes Accelerated Computing, NLP, deep learning (about methods of trainning models), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal training.
